There're two interfaces, one is used to register studients and teacher(moodle) and thi other is google calender in which we need to send invitations all the competitors.
In moodle we can get data from a lot of types, such us: html, json, svs, etc.
In google calender we just need all the competitor's email separated by comma.
Implement a software that listen the last downloaded document in json format and it's be able to just return competitor's email in a txt format of a lot of competitor's data. Remember, after getting downloaded the program have to give a in an opened txt the required data.
